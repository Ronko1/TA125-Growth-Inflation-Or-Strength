# 📈 TA-125 Growth: Inflation, Price Hikes, or True Strength?

## 💡 Behind the Project
During 2024–2025, I noticed a lot of excitement around the Tel Aviv 125 index reaching new highs.  
As a student of both Computer Science and Economics, I started wondering- is this rise due to true economic strength, or could it be a result of inflation and rising prices?

## 🎯 Goal
To explore whether the sharp rise in the TA-125 stock index reflects true economic growth - or if it's primarily a result of inflation and higher cost of living.

## 📊 Data Sources
- TA125 Index (via Yahoo Finance)
- Israeli CPI (Consumer Price Index)
- S&P 500 Index (for comparison)
- Sector composition of both indices

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- yfinance
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights
- TA-125 showed strong growth from 2024–2025, even during wartime.
- CPI in Israel also increased, which initially suggested inflation-driven growth.
- However, deeper analysis showed that the **Tech sector strongly outperformed** Finance - both in TA125 and S&P500.
- This may indicate that the TA125’s growth was more than just inflation.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Always verify data visually and technically.
- Initial assumptions can be wrong and that's okay.
- CPI adjustment requires proper handling of date alignment and clean data.
- Working with multiple data sources gave me a better understanding of real vs. nominal growth.
